# CSS3-Responsive-Registration-Form

While working on this, I learnt how to arrange the layout a webpage for a registration form. The registration form has a interactive user-interface because of the hover effects on the form and the submit button. While working on the registration form, I used the background-image property to create a striped look on the submit button. The hover effect on the form looks like a stack of rectangles appearing under the form. I achieved this using scale, z-index and transition.
